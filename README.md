# AnIndyGame
A game that I made with Unity Engine and C#

==== Legal Disclaimer =======================================================================================

I did not create Indiana Jones, and this is not an official product. It should not be sold or bought, and is intended for private use only.

I did not create the music for the game, the pause menu and some of the images for the enemies. However, all of these assets were open source. The images will also be replaced at some point with ones I will create myself.

==== Game Info ==============================================================================================

An Indy Game is a 2D game I created using Unity Engine and C#, over the course of 2 monthes during the summer. It is loosley based on the scene at the start of Raiders of the Lost Ark, where Indiana Jones attempts to retrieve an idol from an underground temple.

To play the game, extract the files from "Build.zip", and then run the .exe within. The assets are also included in the git resource, so open those in unity to see the source.

Instructions on how to play the game are included in the tutorial level. I'd recommend skipping level 1, as it was the first level I created and is not very good.

===== To Do =================================================================================================

- Remake level 1

- Fix glitch where the gun is drawn on the wrong layer

- Create own version of enemy images

I will not be adding more features or levels, as I would like to move on to a new project. However, if you come across any issues or bugs, feel free to email me at anthony.poole@oriel.ox.ac.uk.
